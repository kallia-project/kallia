While the date and time are accurate, the inclusion of the year 2025 introduces an unnecessary detail not present in the reference answer. Nevertheless, the core information—date, day, and time—is correct and matches the reference.

The response adds extraneous information that goes beyond the scope of the reference answer, making it less aligned with the exact factual content specified in the reference. However, the core instruction about using an HB pencil to fill the bubble is correct and consistent with the reference. Despite the additional details, the main point is accurate.

The reference answer explicitly mentions \"本局方認可的新舊約聖經版本,\" emphasizing the official approval, while the response lacks this key qualification.

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response accurately outlines the procedure for applying for special consideration due to a highly contagious illness on the day of the exam, aligning closely with the reference answer. It correctly specifies contacting the examination board immediately, obtaining a doctor’s certificate on the same day, submitting a written application within 21 calendar days after the exam, and attaching the original doctor’s certificate. It also includes an important note about the non-acceptance of post-exam doctor’s certificates, which is consistent with the reference answer. All key elements—timing, documentation, submission method, and conditions—are correct, precise, and factual. The details provided are comprehensive and strictly adhere to the official procedure described in the reference answer."

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response provides a detailed list of documents required for the re-marking application of the English Language oral examination, including the candidate's identity card, proof of absence, medical certificate, and identification for date changes. However, the reference answer specifies that the only required material is \"口試錄影\" (oral examination recording), which directly indicates the singular, essential document needed. The response adds multiple additional requirements (e.g., identity documents, medical certificates, etc.) that are not aligned with the reference answer. Since the question asks specifically what material must be submitted, and the correct answer is only the oral examination recording, the response overcomplicates and misrepresents the requirement by including unrelated documents. Therefore, the response is not factually accurate according to the reference answer."

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response states that self-taught candidates can submit applications for mark review or script re-marking in person or through an authorized representative at the HKEAA Shiu Tung Centre office, which is not consistent with the reference answer. The reference answer clearly specifies that applications must be submitted directly through the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Online Services, accessible via the official website www.hkdse.hkeaa.edu.hk. The response omits the critical requirement of online submission and incorrectly suggests a physical submission method at a specific office, which contradicts the official procedure. Therefore, the information provided is factually inaccurate and does not align with the correct procedure as stated in the reference answer."

Although the phrasing differs slightly—\"申請積分覆核及／或重閱答卷\" vs. \"申請積分覆核或重閱答卷\"—the meaning remains consistent, and the numerical value (four subjects) is accurate and correct. There is no factual inaccuracy or discrepancy with the reference."

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response states that the application deadline for grade review is 2025年7月21日, but the reference answer clearly indicates the correct date is 2025年8月18日. The provided response is therefore factually incorrect, as it gives a date that does not match the reference answer. There is no indication of partial accuracy or approximation; the date is significantly earlier than the correct one. This constitutes a complete factual error."
