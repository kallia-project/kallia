The response fails to mention the distinction between these two categories, omitting critical information that is present in the reference answer.

The reference answer does not mention a separate deadline for oral exams. The response incorrectly introduces a different deadline for oral exams (2025年2月25日), which is not supported by the reference answer and contradicts its scope.

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response correctly states that a candidate should not attend the exam if suffering from a highly contagious disease, which aligns with the reference answer. It also mentions contacting the examination board (考評局) and submitting an application, which is consistent with the reference. However, it fails to specify the critical procedural details required in the reference answer: the need to call the exam board immediately, to obtain a doctor’s certificate (證明書正本), and to submit the application within 21 calendar days after the exam date. These specific procedural steps are essential and missing in the response, making it incomplete despite containing some accurate elements. The response lacks precision and completeness in key factual requirements, thus falling short of the full accuracy expected for a score of 5."

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response correctly states that self-taught candidates must submit applications directly to the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) through the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Online Services, and includes the correct website address: www.hkdse.hkeaa.edu.hk. The information provided matches the reference answer exactly in content and accuracy, with only a minor difference in formatting (the inclusion of the \"http://\" prefix in the response, which does not affect factual correctness). The response is fully aligned with the reference answer in both substance and factual accuracy."

While the reference answer is more concise, the response is factually accurate, complete, and fully consistent with the reference."

    "evaluation_score": 1,
    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response states that the deadline for applying for grade review is within 5 calendar days after the release of results, which is a general rule that may apply in some contexts but does not match the specific date provided in the reference answer (2025年8月18日). Since the instruction asks for the exact deadline date and the reference answer specifies a concrete date, the response fails to provide the required factual detail. Instead, it gives a relative timeframe that lacks specificity and does not align with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is not factually accurate in the context of the instruction and reference."

    "true_answer": "否",
    "generated_answer": "根據提供的上下文，沒有提及 HP-65 型號的計算機，因此無法確認該型號是否被列入附錄的准用計算機型號名單中。",
    "evaluation_score": 3,
    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response states that the context does not mention the HP-65 model, so it cannot be confirmed whether it is listed in the approved calculator model list. However, the reference answer is simply \"否\" (no), which directly and correctly answers the question by denying the inclusion of the HP-65 in the list. The response, while acknowledging the lack of information, fails to provide the definitive factual answer required. It avoids stating a clear \"no\" despite the reference answer being unambiguously \"否\". The response is therefore not fully aligned with the reference answer in terms of factual correctness and completeness, as it refrains from asserting the correct conclusion even when the context implies it. This results in a lack of accuracy and factual alignment with the reference."
