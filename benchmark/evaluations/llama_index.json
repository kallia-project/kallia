While these details are consistent with the official procedures of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE), the reference answer only states that the candidate's paper may not be marked by the exam board, which is the core fact. The additional procedural details in the response, though accurate, go beyond the scope of the reference answer and are not required for a score of 5. However, since the response does not contain any inaccuracies and aligns with the reference answer in the key point—namely, that the paper may not be marked—the response remains factually correct and fully aligned with the reference. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 5."

The response fails to mention the fee for school candidates and does not clarify that the $1,024 applies specifically to self-registered candidates.

While the date, day, and time range are accurate, the inclusion of the year (2025) introduces unnecessary and potentially incorrect information, as the context does not confirm this year.

The reference answer is concise and directly aligned with the core requirement. The provided response, although factually correct in parts, exceeds the scope of the reference answer by adding extraneous information. Since the rubric evaluates whether the response is correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer, and the reference answer is narrowly focused on the act of filling in the circle with an HB pencil, the response deviates from the reference by including non-essential details. However, the core instruction (using HB pencil to fill the circle) is correct and consistent with the reference.

    "evaluation_feedback": "The response correctly identifies that a candidate with a highly contagious illness on exam day can apply for special consideration and emphasizes the need to submit documentation such as a doctor's certificate. It also correctly notes that applications must be submitted before the deadline and that the examination body will assess based on prior performance or issue a review grade if applicable. However, it fails to mention the critical requirement of contacting the examination board immediately on the day of the exam, which is explicitly stated in the reference answer as \"必須按規定程序致電考評局備案\" (must contact the examination board via the prescribed procedure). Additionally, the response incorrectly states that the candidate \"不得於考試當天致電考評局,\" which contradicts the reference answer and is factually wrong. This omission and incorrect information significantly undermine the accuracy and completeness of the response. While the response contains several correct elements, it misses a key procedural step and includes a false restriction. Therefore, it does not fully align with the reference answer in terms of accuracy and factual correctness."
