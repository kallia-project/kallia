The wording is slightly different but conveys the same meaning, and all key elements—failure to present documents, the consequence (non-marking), and the responsible body (Examination and Assessment Authority)—are correctly included.

The response fails to mention the distinction between these two categories, thereby omitting crucial information. Although the figure $215 is factually accurate for school candidates, the lack of differentiation makes the response incomplete and not fully aligned with the reference answer, which provides both cases.

However, the instruction asks specifically about the fee for \"甲類科目\" (Category A subjects) for \"覆核成績申請\" (re-marking application), and the reference answer distinguishes between school candidates ($855) and self-taught candidates ($1,024). Since the response only provides one value without specifying the category or context, it lacks completeness. While the amount is factually correct for self-taught candidates, the absence of clarification on who it applies to makes the response incomplete in the context of the full reference answer. Despite this, the numerical value is correct for a specific group, which aligns with part of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct and factual."

The reference answer explicitly differentiates between school candidates and self-registered candidates, and the response omits this crucial distinction.

While these details are practical and relevant to exam procedures, they go beyond the scope of the reference answer, which is concise and focuses solely on the essential fact: using an HB pencil to fill in the corresponding circles. The reference answer does not mention erasing, multiple answers, or paper separation. Since the rubric evaluates correctness, accuracy, and factual alignment with the reference answer, the response, while factually sound in a broader context, includes additional information not present in or implied by the reference answer. However, it does not contradict the reference answer. The core instruction—using an HB pencil to fill in the circles—is accurately and correctly stated.

    "evaluation_feedback": "Feedback: The response includes additional procedural details beyond the reference answer, such as the requirement to contact the examination board by phone, the submission timeline, the role of the school for school candidates, the need for school examination scores, and the conditions for document submission. While these details are generally consistent with standard procedures for special accommodations in examination systems, the reference answer only specifies the core actions: contacting the exam board and submitting a doctor’s certificate within 21 calendar days. The response introduces elements (e.g., school submission, provision of mock exam results, document acceptance criteria) that are not mentioned in the reference answer. Since the evaluation criterion focuses strictly on whether the response is correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer—without considering whether it includes extra but plausible details—the inclusion of unmentioned procedural steps, even if plausible, risks overcomplication and potential inaccuracy in alignment with the reference. However, the core elements (contacting the board, obtaining a doctor’s certificate, submitting within 21 days) are accurate and consistent with the reference. Despite the added details, the response does not contradict the reference and remains factually sound. Therefore, it is aligned with the reference in its essential points and does not introduce factual errors."

This aligns with the reference answer \"口試錄影\" (oral exam video), as it correctly identifies the required material. The phrasing is slightly more detailed than the reference, but it accurately conveys the essential information without introducing any inaccuracy or irrelevance. The core fact—submitting the oral exam video—is correct and directly matches the reference."

The only minor difference is the absence of a colon after \"網址\" in the response, which does not affect factual accuracy.
