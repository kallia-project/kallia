# Welcome to Kallia Playground! 🚀📄

**Interactive PDF Document Q&A System**

Welcome to the Kallia Playground - an interactive demonstration of intelligent document processing and question-answering capabilities. This playground showcases how Kallia transforms PDF documents into semantic chunks and enables natural language queries about your documents.

## 🎯 What is Kallia Playground?

Kallia Playground is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that:

- **Processes PDF documents** using advanced semantic chunking
- **Converts documents** into meaningful, context-aware segments
- **Enables natural language Q&A** about your uploaded documents
- **Provides source references** for every answer with exact content citations

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Upload Your PDF

- Click the upload button when prompted
- Select any PDF document (up to 20MB)
- Supported formats: PDF files only

### Step 2: Watch the Magic Happen

- Kallia processes your document page by page
- Each page is converted to markdown format
- Content is intelligently chunked into semantic segments
- Chunks are embedded and stored in a vector database

### Step 3: Ask Questions

- Once processing is complete, start asking questions about your document
- Use natural language - no special syntax required
- Get answers with source references showing exactly where information came from

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🧠 **Semantic Chunking**

- Intelligent content segmentation that preserves meaning and context
- Respects document structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- Maintains relationships between related content

### 🔍 **Advanced Retrieval**

- Vector similarity search for relevant content discovery
- Context-aware matching beyond simple keyword search
- Multi-page document support with page-specific references

### 📚 **Source Attribution**

- Every answer includes references to source chunks
- View original content that informed each response
- Transparent and verifiable information retrieval

### 🎨 **Real-time Processing**

- Live progress updates during document processing
- Page-by-page processing feedback
- Immediate availability for questioning once complete

## 🔧 Technical Overview

The Kallia Playground implements a sophisticated document processing pipeline:

1. **Document Ingestion**: PDF upload and validation
2. **Content Extraction**: PDF → Markdown conversion using vision-language models
3. **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent text segmentation preserving context
4. **Embedding Generation**: Vector representations using HuggingFace embeddings
5. **Vector Storage**: In-memory vector store for similarity search
6. **Query Processing**: Natural language question understanding
7. **Retrieval**: Semantic similarity search for relevant chunks
8. **Generation**: LLM-powered answer synthesis with source attribution

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Research Papers**: Ask about methodologies, findings, or conclusions
- **Technical Documentation**: Query specific procedures or requirements
- **Reports**: Extract key insights, statistics, or recommendations
- **Manuals**: Find specific instructions or troubleshooting steps
- **Legal Documents**: Locate relevant clauses or definitions
