# Introduction to Kallia

Kallia is a cutting-edge semantic document processing library designed to transform documents into intelligent, queryable knowledge bases. Built with modern AI technologies and robust engineering practices, Kallia bridges the gap between raw document content and meaningful, actionable insights.

## What Makes Kallia Special?

### ðŸŽ¯ Semantic Understanding

Unlike traditional document processors that rely on simple text extraction, Kallia employs advanced semantic analysis to understand document structure, context, and meaning. This results in more accurate and useful content extraction.

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Chunking

Kallia's semantic chunking algorithm doesn't just split text at arbitrary boundaries. Instead, it:

- Analyzes document structure and content flow
- Creates meaningful segments that preserve context
- Generates summaries, questions, and answers for each chunk
- Optimizes chunks for retrieval and comprehension

### ðŸ’¾ Memory Management

The library features a sophisticated memory system that:

- Maintains short-term conversation context
- Extracts long-term insights and patterns
- Builds contextual understanding across interactions
- Enables intelligent follow-up conversations

## Core Architecture

### Document Processing Pipeline
