# ðŸ’¡ What we do

Kallia transforms the way you process and understand documents by converting them into intelligent, semantic chunks that preserve meaning and context. Our library bridges the gap between raw document content and AI-ready structured data.

## Our Mission

We believe that document processing should be more than just text extraction. Kallia focuses on understanding the semantic relationships within documents, enabling better AI applications, improved search capabilities, and more meaningful content analysis.

## Core Capabilities

### ðŸ”„ Document Processing

Convert various document formats (starting with PDFs) into clean, structured markdown while preserving formatting and semantic structure.

### ðŸ§  Semantic Chunking

Break down documents into meaningful segments that respect natural boundaries like paragraphs, sections, and topics rather than arbitrary character limits.

### ðŸ’­ Memory Generation

Transform conversational histories into structured memories that can be used for context-aware AI applications and long-term conversation management.

### ðŸš€ API-First Design

Built with FastAPI to provide robust, scalable endpoints for all document processing needs with comprehensive error handling and validation.

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Experience

Includes a Chainlit-powered playground for real-time document Q&A and testing, making it easy to experiment with your documents.
